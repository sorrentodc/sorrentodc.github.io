Sorrento Dental Clinic accepts all major health funds, offering rebates that are claimable on the spot using our Hicaps system.  

If supported, customers are also able to apply their health fund ‘Loyalty Bonus’ covering the complete cost of dental treatment.

For several years we have been HBF preferred providers, which means patients claiming from HBF will ensure they receive their maximum possible rebate, and lowest out-of-pocket costs for treatment. HBF recently overhauled their preferred provider system, which is now named HBF Member Plus dentists. At Sorrento Dental Clinic we have joined the new system, which means improved rebates on diagnostic and preventative services, including a free scale and clean each calendar year. Rebates for restorative services, including fillings, dentures and crowns have changed significantly. 

After your initial examination we are able to provide you with a treatment plan as well as a cost estimate. You are able to use that information to find out exactly how much rebate you will receive from your health fund and how much you will be out of pocket.

No matter which health fund you are a member of, it is a good idea to regularly check what your benefits are, and whether your current plan is still the best one for you.
